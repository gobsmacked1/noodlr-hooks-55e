# Changelog

## 0.1.0

First release. Everything here was previously part of [Noodlr](https://github.com/gobsmacked1/noodlr)
and has been split out into a module of its own, so that a table wanting D&D 5e (2024) rules
automation does not have to install an AI game master to get it — and so that the rules work can grow
without weighing down a module that is meant to be game-system agnostic.

If you are upgrading from Noodlr 0.4.x, install this alongside it. Your combat settings are copied
across automatically the first time a GM loads the world, and every actor flag you have already built
into an Active Effect keeps working.

### What this module does

- **Action economy.** One action, one bonus action and one reaction per turn, counted properly.
  Attacks and actions are separate currencies, so a fighter's second swing is never blocked; Extra
  Attack is read from the sheet and Multiattack is parsed from the stat block. Extra damage riders
  like Sneak Attack cost nothing, because they are not actions.
- **Speed.** A creature's Speed limits how far it can be dragged in a turn, with difficult terrain
  costing what core says it costs. Dash is charged when the line is crossed — as a bonus action for
  anyone with Cunning Action, Step of the Wind or Expeditious Retreat.
- **Conditions.** Advantage and disadvantage, auto-failed Strength and Dexterity saves, critical hits
  within five feet of a Paralyzed or Unconscious creature, and the refusal to act while Incapacitated.
  Stands aside entirely when Automated Conditions 5e is installed and enabled.
- **Dying and death.** Unconscious at 0 hit points, Dead on massive damage, death-save failures from
  damage taken while down, and stabilisation. NPCs marked Important get death saves like characters.
  Every ruling is undoable from the card it posts.
- **Concentration.** The save is rolled on the client that owns the creature — the player's own
  browser for a character — and a failure actually ends the spell, as does being Incapacitated, dying
  or reaching 0 hit points. Stands aside when midi-qol's concentration handling is on.
- **Stealth and surprise.** Declared hiding is contested against each observer's passive Perception,
  accounting for walls, fog banks, magical darkness, illusions and every sense on the stat block.
  Attacking reveals you — unless you have Skulker and missed. Creatures caught unaware are marked
  Surprised before initiative is rolled.
- **Forced movement.** Pushes, pulls, shoves and the Push weapon mastery move the target, respecting
  walls, scene edges, creature footprints and where it would land. Reversible from every card.
- **Reactions.** Opportunity attacks when a creature leaves your reach, and hitting back when hurt
  off-turn. Native, with no module required, and it stands aside for Gambit's Premades.
- **Hostile creatures that start their own fights.** A sentry that notices the party rolls
  initiative, shouts for whoever is within earshot, and begins the encounter — without waiting for
  the GM to press anything.
- **Monster turns without an AI.** A deterministic tactical planner reads a creature's real sheet and
  picks a plausible action for what it actually is. Nine cognition tiers derived from Intelligence and
  Wisdom decide what it can conceive of, how reliably it acts on the best idea, and how many options
  it weighs at all. Choices are seeded, so a turn replays identically and nothing can be reroll-shopped.
- **Encounters that end without a body count.** Flight, surrender and mercy are real outcomes, with
  experience awarded for what is left on the field and a one-click undo on anything a mercy took.

### Notes

- Every setting is in Foundry's own **Configure Settings → Module Settings**.
- Diagnostics live on the module API: `api.explainTurn()`, `api.testMove()`, `api.surveyEconomy()`,
  `api.surveyPerception()`, `api.surveyActions({ saveToFile: true })` and one survey per rules layer.
- Installed alongside Noodlr, the two find each other automatically: rulings, behaviour requests and
  turn announcements cross on `noodlrHooks.*` hooks so the AI can narrate, voice and overrule.
